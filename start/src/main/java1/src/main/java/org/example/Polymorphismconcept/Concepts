Overloading:--->

1. It is a feature under the POLYMORPHISM concept which means POLY(Many)  MORPHISM(forms)
and in this the same name methods can be created with same functionality and can be called to provide result.

2. It is also called as the COMPILE TIME POLYMORPHISM because in this the compiler shows the error
at the compile time that is after execution of program there would be no error in the program bcz the
program will not run if there is any error in it.

3.In this the functionality of the Methods is same but the way of their declaration that is their parameters,
data types may differ.

4. It is done within the same class

    (content from internet about overloading)

  What is Method Overloading in Java?
   Method overloading in Java means having two or more methods (or functions) in a class with the same name
   and different arguments (or parameters).
   It can be with a different number of arguments or different data types of arguments.


   OVERRIDING

 1. More than one class is needed to perform the Overriding
 2.In this the name of the methods is same but their functionality is different.
 3.It is also called as RUN TIME POLYMORPHISM bcz the compiler will not show any error in the code
 but after compilation and during run time the error will be shown if the code persists any error.


    (from google)

 In Java, Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method
 that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. When a method in a subclass has the same name, the same parameters or signature, and the same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class,
  then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.
