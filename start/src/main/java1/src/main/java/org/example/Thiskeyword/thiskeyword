"this" keyword is used to assign the values via the constructor to the fields or the variables
in the program and in this we make a method as same as the name of the class and then
the parameters are passed directly into the class name method


  The this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor. The most common use of the this keyword is
   to eliminate the confusion between class attributes and parameters with the same name
   (because a class attribute is shadowed by a method or constructor parameter).
