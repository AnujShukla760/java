Encapsulation in Java refers to integrating data (variables) and code (methods) into a single unit.
In encapsulation, a class's variables are hidden from other classes and can
only be accessed by the methods of the class in which they are found.


Getter And setter:-

You learned from the previous chapter that private variables
can only be accessed within the same class (an outside class has no access to it).
However, it is possible to access them if we provide public get and set methods.

The (get) method returns the variable value, and the ( set )method sets the value.

Syntax for both is that they start with either get or set,
followed by the name of the variable, with the first letter in upper case:

eg: public class Person {
      private String name; // private = restricted access

      // GETTER
      public String getName() {
        return name;
      }

      // SETTER
      public void setName(String newName) {
        this.name = newName;
      }
    }



    Example explained

    The get method returns the value of the variable name.

    The set method takes a parameter (newName) and assigns it to the name variable.
    The this keyword is used to refer to the current object.
