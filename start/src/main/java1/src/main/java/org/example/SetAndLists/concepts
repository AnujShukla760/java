Difference between List and Set:
               List 	                                              Set
1. The List is an indexed sequence. 	          1. The Set is an non-indexed sequence.
2. List allows duplicate elements 	              2. Set doesnâ€™t allow duplicate elements.
3. Elements by their position can be accessed. 	   3. Position access to elements is not allowed.
4. Multiple null elements can be stored.    	   4. Null element can store only once.
5. List implementations are ArrayList,             5. Set implementations are HashSet, LinkedHashSet.
LinkedList, Vector, Stack


               <..................Add() And Remove() methods...........>
1..    add() method:------->

 The add() method of Set in Java is used to add a specific element into a Set collection.
 The set add() function adds the element only if the specified element is not
  already present in the set else the function returns False if the element is already present in the set.

2...  remove() method:-------->

 The remove() method of Java Collection Interface is used to remove a single instance of the
 specified element from this collection.

            <...............................ITERATOR..............................>

An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet.
 It is called an "iterator" because "iterating" is the technical term for looping.

To use an Iterator, you must import it from the java.util package.

Getting an Iterator:.>

The iterator() method can be used to get an Iterator for any collection:
